# Air-Pollution-Data-Analytics-NIT-Warangal

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes air pollution trends in and around NIT Warangal by combining government datasets with on-campus measurements.  
The goal was to assess indoor vs. outdoor air quality, compare with city-level benchmarks, and visualize pollution patterns.

## 🔍 Data Sources
- Government datasets (Pollution Control Board, real-time stations)  
- On-campus measurements (High Volume Sampler, Temtop Air Quality Monitor)  
- Duration: March 2025 sampling + 2024 archival data  

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in **Excel (formulas, validation, pivoting)**  
- Computed averages and trends using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**  
- Graphical visualization in **Pandas (Matplotlib)**  
- Compared NIT Warangal campus data vs. Warangal city benchmarks  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Campus AQI levels consistently lower than city benchmarks, confirming green shielding effect.  
- Higher PM2.5 concentrations observed near hostels and food street zones.  
- CO₂ accumulation identified in closed facilities with poor ventilation.  
- Seasonal wind direction impacted boundary conditions significantly.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Applied
- **Excel** (data cleaning, validation)  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**  
- **Data visualization & interpretation**
